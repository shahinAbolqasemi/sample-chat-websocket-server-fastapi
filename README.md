## The fun app to understand how does work the WebSocket app

---

This app has a very simple front-end UI only to work with it that runs by Gunicorn in the main.py
module and you must run the main.py in the project directory after install requirements.
    
    cd {prject_directory} &&
    virtualenv venv -p python3.9 &&
    source venv/bin/activate &&
    pip install -r requirements.txt &&
    python main.py

Now, it is running on [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
